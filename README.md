# Climbable
Climbable is a small mod/library that allows you to do a few things:
1. Add full blocks to the `climbable` tag. Want climbable cobblestone? Climbable dirt? Now you can have it!
2. Set different climbing speeds for different blocks.
3. Conditionally climbable blocks.
4. Variable climbing speed.

Climbable is available on Maven:
```groovy
